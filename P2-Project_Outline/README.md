## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Build a website to assist in the planning of activities that involve lots of equipment. I had initially thought about this project in terms of outdoor activities such as camping, backpacking, or climbing. But I think it could be used any time someone has a need for creating a list from a larger list of items. Generally, it would allow someone to create a list of items that could then be added to a trip/event. The items could have customized properties similar to properties in a class in Java (boolean for if item is clean, string for notes, int counter for weight, stuff like that). Designed for ultimate flexibility, I think this could be helpful in a lot of situations. 

A multi-day backpacking trip in the wilderness nearly requires something like this. In packing for one of these trips, there is a balance between making your trip more enjoyable and weighing yourself down (literally). Often, the more luxury, the more weight, leading to lots of equipment options and decisions about what to bring. Often it's impractical, or just a pain, to get all of your equipment out for planning so it is very nice to have everything in an accessible list.
